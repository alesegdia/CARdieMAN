"Runner" game for android using LibGDX.

I plan on publishing **CARdieMAN** soon at the store with a few ads and see if I can earn
a couple of beers. Anyway, the purpose of placing all the code, graphics, music and sfx
here is just to let anyone build its own free-from-ads version, or just check how
it is done, but **NOT** ~~steal~~ release, modify or sell it.
