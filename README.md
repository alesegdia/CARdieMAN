CARdieMAN
=========

"Runner" game for android using LibGDX.

I plan on publishing **CARdieMAN** soon at the store with a few ads and see if I can earn
a couple of beers.

The purpose of placing all the code, graphics, music and sfx
here is just to let anyone build its own free-from-ads version, or just check how
it is done, but **NOT** ~~steal~~ release at the store or sell it. You can share a build at
common sharing websites or p2p if you want **ONLY IF** you give credits and link to this
github repository and you **DO NOT** earn any money and/or credits with it.

I am a very convinced free software supporter, so I ask you to thoroughly follow these statements.
